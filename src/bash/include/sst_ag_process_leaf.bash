# When discussing a makefile target, a "child" of the target is any
# direct prerequisite, and a "leaf" of the target is any direct or
# indirect prerequisite that has no further prerequisites.
#

# TODO: The first parameter should eventually be removed. Our "target"
#       should just follow along the filesystem structure. For example,
#       if we process foo/bar/baz.ag, we should produce:
#
#             foo_bar_leaves += foo/bar.ag
#             foo_bar_children_nodist += foo/bar
#             foo_leaves += $(foo_bar_leaves)
#             foo_children_nodist += $(foo_bar_children_nodist)
#
#       Note how this walks up the directory chain, so that "make foo"
#       will build everything inside the foo directory.
