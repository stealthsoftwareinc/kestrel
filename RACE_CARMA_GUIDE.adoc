== **Terminology**
*add implementation-specific terms and acronyms*


== **Introduction**

Within the RACE program, Technical Area 1 plugins provide the logic
that powers the overall distributed network. The system is a
collection of client and server nodes, and the nodes need to be told
how to operate. Our TA1 plugin, CARMA, instructs the nodes in the
RACE system how to behave. It informs which nodes should be connected
under which TA2 channels, the roles they serve, when and how to pass
messages, and how to perform the proper duties to meet the design
goals of robustness and anonymity.

The overall approach is to set up mixing committees that perform
secure multiparty computation-based mixing to achieve unlinkability,
and then have mailbox servers acts as entry points for clients which
then forward messages to the mixers.

*High-level Paragraph: State what this plugin accomplishes*


=== **Design Goals**

From a cryptographic standpoint, we outline several important design
goals that our CARMA anonymous messaging system should have: Authenticity, confidentiality, end-to-end encryption, robustness against faults and malicious behavior, unlinkability.




=== **Security Considerations**

This is a research prototype, focused primarily on novel ways of
achieving mixing for anonymity while maintaining robustness.

When deploying in an actual environment, one must consider who is the adversary, what are you trying to protect, what are your assumptions, and many other considerations.

Stating areas where this system can improve will help guide the reader across potential pitfalls.  It is well known that end-to-end secure messaging is notoriously difficult to get right, especially if one wants to strike a balance between convenience and security.

An independent security audit would be one of the steps towards preparing our results for real-world use.



== **Scope**
This developer guide covers the *[Project Name]* development model, building artifacts, running, and troubleshooting. It is structured this way to first provide context, associate attributes/features with source files, then guide a developer through the build process.

*additional detail as appropriate*


=== **Audience**
*State assumptions about reader (e.g. familiarity with technologies utilized, etc)*

=== **Environment**
*supported hosts and resource recommendations*

*(e.g. runs on Linux and Android hosts)*

*(e.g. X RAM, Y SSD recommended)*

=== **License**
*State all license related information*

=== **Additional Reading**
*Reference TBD User Guide, RACE dev guide, and appropriate TA dev guide*

*More specifically [Other File](relative/file/path.file)*


== **Implementation Overview**
*Top-level paragraph of what's in this project. Additional detail on what this accomplishes (as appropriate)*

*Provide additional detail for terms defined in Terminology (as appropriate)*

*How is this expected to work in a RACE deployment?*

*Mermaid flow diagram(s) to illustrate internal state, and other interesting inter-workings*

There are several Mermaid diagrams in this document. See https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams for more info about viewing Mermaid diagrams in github. Mermaid diagrams can also be viewed in Visual Studio with Marketplace extensions: Markdown, and Markdown Preview Mermaid Support.

== **Implementation Organization**
*description of each directory or file with detail sufficient to direct readers to specific attribute/functionality they may wish to inspect or change*

*map attributes to implementation in the following*
=== **Feature/Attribute I**
- *file/directory Q supports attribute I by ...*
- *file/directory R supports attribute I by ...*
=== **Feature/Attribute J**
- *file/directory S supports attribute J by ...*
- *file/directory T supports attribute J by ...*



== **How To Build**
*General build environment detail as appropriate (state what each artifact does, build considerations Linux vs Android)*



=== The Kestrel RACE Artifactory archive

The Kestrel RACE Artifactory archive contains a RACE-specific build of
all Kestrel plugins (one of which is CARMA), compiled for multiple
platforms and architectures.
Here, "RACE-specific" means that each plugin is compiled into a single
shared object (`.so`) file that implements the small C interface the
RACE system uses to create and destroy instances of the plugin.
After it has an instance of the plugin, the RACE system uses the RACE
{cpp} interface to make calls to the plugin, and the plugin uses the
interface to make calls to the RACE SDK.

The Kestrel RACE Artifactory archive can be built from any Linux-based
environment with Docker installed.
The following code shows how to build it from a fresh Ubuntu system:

// TODO: The RACE Docker registry will be different after full open
//       sourcing. It will probably be public and won't require running
//       "docker login", and the image URLs may be different.

:race_docker_registry: gitlab.race.twosixlabs.com:4567

# Install some basic packages.
sudo apt-get -q -y install \

# Install Docker and reboot.
curl -L -S -f -s \https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

# Clone the Kestrel repository.
git clone \git@github.com:stealthsoftwareinc/kestrel.git

# This may take a while depending on how large you can set
# DOCKERFILE_THREADS.
#
# You can increase DOCKERFILE_THREADS depending on how many CPUs and how
# much memory you have. It is not recommended to set DOCKERFILE_THREADS
# any larger than min(N, K/2), where N is how many CPUs you have and K
# is how much memory you have in GB. It is also not recommended to use
# the -j option of make if you set DOCKERFILE_THREADS > 1.

./configure
make src/artifactory DOCKERFILE_THREADS=1

This will produce the file
